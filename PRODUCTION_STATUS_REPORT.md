## ⚠️ **Issues to Address**

### **🔴 High Priority**

#### **1. Redis Connection Timeout**
```json
{"redis": {"status": "error", "message": "Redis connection timeout"}}
```
- **Impact**: Session management, real-time features, caching affected
- **Fix**: Update Redis URL or switch to production Redis service

#### **2. File Upload Service Status**
- **Need to verify**: Are S3 uploads working with production bucket?
- **Test**: Content creator upload functionality

#### **3. Payment Processing**
- **Need to verify**: Are Stripe live keys active and functional?
- **Test**: Subscription creation and artist payouts

### **🟡 Medium Priority**

#### **4. Some Routes Return 404**
- `/login` returns "Page Not Found" 
- May be routing configuration or authentication middleware

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **Step 1: Fix Redis Connection (15 minutes)**

Your Redis is timing out. Options:

**Option A: Use Upstash Redis (Recommended)**
```bash
# Set up Upstash Redis for production
# URL format: redis://default:password@region.upstash.io:port
```

**Option B: Disable Redis temporarily**
```bash
# Update environment variable to skip Redis
REDIS_URL="" # Empty to disable
```

### **Step 2: Test Core Functionality (30 minutes)**

Let's verify these critical flows work:
1. **User Registration** → Create artist and fan accounts
2. **Content Upload** → Test file upload to S3
3. **Payment Flow** → Test subscription creation
4. **Real-time Features** → Messaging and notifications

### **Step 3: Production Launch (1 hour)**

Once core flows are verified:
1. **Marketing Launch** → Social media announcement
2. **Monitor Performance** → Watch error rates and user activity
3. **Iterate Based on Feedback** → Fix issues as they arise
