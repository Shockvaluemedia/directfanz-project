## URGENT: Update Hostinger Nameservers

**Current Issue**: Domain still shows Hostinger parking page

**Required Action**: 
1. Go to Hostinger control panel
2. Find directfanz.io domain settings
3. Change nameservers to:

```
ns-1186.awsdns-20.org
ns-413.awsdns-51.com
ns-536.awsdns-03.net
ns-1580.awsdns-05.co.uk
```

**Result**: DirectFanz will be live at https://directfanz.io within 5-10 minutes after nameserver update

**Current Status**: AWS infrastructure is ready and running
