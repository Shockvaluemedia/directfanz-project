## 🔒 Security Considerations

### 1. Webhook Security
- Always verify webhook signatures
- Use HTTPS endpoints only
- Implement idempotency for webhook processing

### 2. Customer Data Protection
- PCI compliance through Stripe
- No card data stored locally
- Encrypted customer information

### 3. Platform Fee Security
- Automatic fee calculation
- Cannot be bypassed by artists
- Transparent fee structure

## 💰 Fee Structure

### Platform Fees
- **Standard Rate**: 5% of all transactions

- **Artist Receives**: ~92.1% of payment minus $0.30

### Fee Calculation Example
```
Fan Payment: $10.00
Platform Fee (5%): $0.50
Stripe Fee (~3%): $0.30
Artist Receives: $9.20
