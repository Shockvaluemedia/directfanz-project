  - Application performance monitoring (APM)
  - User reports
  - Automated scanning tools
  - Third-party security notifications

#### 1.2 Initial Assessment
```bash
# Quick system check commands
./scripts/security-monitoring.js
npm run security:monitor:report
./scripts/backup-system.sh list
```

- Verify the incident is legitimate
- Determine initial severity level
- Document initial findings
- Activate incident response team if necessary

#### 1.3 Communication Protocol
- **CRITICAL**: Immediately notify all stakeholders
- **HIGH**: Notify security team and business owner within 30 minutes
- **MEDIUM/LOW**: Document in incident management system

### Phase 2: Containment (15-60 minutes)

#### 2.1 Immediate Containment
```bash
# Emergency system isolation (if needed)
# Stop affected services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml stop

# Block suspicious IPs
# iptables -A INPUT -s [SUSPICIOUS_IP] -j DROP

# Rotate compromised credentials immediately
# Update environment variables in production
```

#### 2.2 System Isolation
- Isolate affected systems from network if necessary
- Preserve system state for forensic analysis
- Implement temporary workarounds if possible
- Document all containment actions taken

#### 2.3 Evidence Preservation
```bash
# Create incident snapshot
INCIDENT_ID="INC-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "./incidents/$INCIDENT_ID"

# Collect system logs
cp *.log "./incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/"
cp -r logs/ "./incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/"

# Capture system state
ps aux > "./incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/processes.txt"
netstat -tulpn > "./incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/network.txt"
df -h > "./incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/disk-usage.txt"
```

### Phase 3: Eradication (1-4 hours)

#### 3.1 Root Cause Analysis
- Analyze logs and system artifacts
- Identify attack vectors or failure points
- Determine scope of the incident
- Identify all affected systems and data

#### 3.2 Remove Threats
```bash
# Update all compromised credentials
./scripts/setup-secrets-management.sh

# Apply security patches
npm audit fix
npm update

# Rebuild compromised systems if necessary
./scripts/backup-system.sh restore [TIMESTAMP]
```

#### 3.3 Strengthen Defenses
- Apply security patches
- Update security configurations
- Implement additional monitoring
- Update access controls

### Phase 4: Recovery (2-8 hours)

#### 4.1 System Restoration
```bash
# Restore from clean backups if necessary
./scripts/backup-system.sh restore [CLEAN_BACKUP_TIMESTAMP]

# Verify system integrity
npm run security:check
./scripts/security-monitoring.js

# Gradual service restoration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

#### 4.2 Monitoring and Verification
- Monitor system performance and security
- Verify all services are functioning correctly
- Confirm threat has been eliminated
- Test critical business functions

#### 4.3 Communication Updates
- Notify stakeholders of recovery progress
- Update incident status
- Provide estimated time to full resolution

### Phase 5: Post-Incident Activities (24-72 hours)

#### 5.1 Documentation
- Complete incident report
- Document lessons learned
- Update runbooks and procedures
- Create timeline of events

#### 5.2 Process Improvements
- Identify gaps in detection or response
- Update monitoring and alerting rules
- Improve security controls
- Enhance incident response procedures

## 🔒 Security Incident Specific Procedures

### Data Breach Response

#### Immediate Actions (0-1 hour)
1. **Stop the breach**
   ```bash
   # Immediately revoke all API keys and access tokens
   # Block suspicious IP addresses
   # Isolate affected databases
   ```

2. **Assess the scope**
   - Determine what data was accessed
