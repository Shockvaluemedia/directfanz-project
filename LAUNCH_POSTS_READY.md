🚀 Excited to announce the soft launch of DirectFanZ.io!

After months of development, we're live with a creator-first platform that addresses the biggest pain point in the creator economy: unfair revenue splits.

🎯 What makes DirectFanZ different:
• 95% revenue share for creators (vs 70-80% on major platforms)
• Direct fan relationships without algorithmic interference
• Multi-tier subscription system with flexible pricing
• Real-time messaging and community features
• Enterprise-grade security with content protection

We're looking for beta creators who want to be part of something revolutionary from day one. If you're a creator tired of platforms taking 20-30% of your hard work, check us out.
