## üí° **Why 5% is Strategic Genius**

### **1. Market Disruption Strategy**
```
Traditional Platform: "We'll take 20% because we can"
DirectFanZ: "We'll take 5% and win through volume"
```

**The Logic:**
- Lower fees = happier creators = more creators
- More creators = more fans = more transactions
- More transactions at 5% > Fewer transactions at 20%

### **2. Competitive Moat**
- **Impossible to undercut significantly** (payment processing ~3% is floor)
- **Sustainable at scale** (low marginal costs)
- **Creator loyalty driver** (switching cost is huge fee difference)

### **3. Network Effects**
```
More Creators ‚Üí More Content ‚Üí More Fans ‚Üí More Revenue ‚Üí Better Platform ‚Üí More Creators
```

## üéØ **Strategic Advantages of 5% Model**

### **1. Creator Acquisition**
- **Primary selling point**: "Keep 92% vs 77% elsewhere"

Option B: 3,000 creators √ó $500/month √ó 5% = $75,000 revenue

At 4,000+ creators, 5% model wins!
```
