## 🛠️ **Resolution Options**

### **Option 1: Apply Database Migrations (RECOMMENDED)**
**Action**: Run Prisma migrations to create missing tables

**Steps**:
1. Connect to production database
2. Run `npx prisma db push` or `npx prisma migrate deploy`
3. Verify table creation
4. Test streaming functionality

**Timeline**: 15-30 minutes
**Risk**: Low (adds tables, doesn't modify existing data)

### **Option 2: Launch Without Streaming (IMMEDIATE)**
**Action**: Temporarily disable streaming features for launch

**Steps**:
1. Hide streaming UI components
2. Remove streaming navigation
3. Focus on core platform features
4. Add streaming in future update

**Timeline**: Immediate
**Risk**: None (removes non-functional features)

### **Option 3: Mock Streaming Data (QUICK FIX)**
**Action**: Return mock/demo data for streaming until database is fixed

**Steps**:
1. API returns sample streaming data
2. UI shows demo streams
3. Users can see the interface
4. Real functionality added after DB fix

**Timeline**: 30 minutes
**Risk**: Low (users understand it's demo)
