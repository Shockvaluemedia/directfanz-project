# Git Workflow & Deployment Setup

## Current Status

✅ **Main branch created** with all production features merged
✅ **Vercel configuration updated** for Hobby plan compatibility
✅ **Deployment automation** scripts added
⚠️ **Branch protection** preventing direct push to origin/main

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Created Main Branch
- Branched from: `claude/setup-production-deployment-011CUbNvVuZPsm3CSxgnxKGc`
- Contains: All deployment setup + production features

### 2. Merged Origin/Main
Successfully merged 300+ files including:
- Production stability features
- WebSocket server
- Supabase integration
- OpenAI & AI agents
- Content optimization
- Mobile app features
- PWA support
- Testing infrastructure

### 3. Resolved Conflicts
- `vercel.json`: Combined Hobby plan config with redirects
- `package.json`: Merged all deployment scripts

### 4. Fixed Vercel Configuration
- Removed Pro plan features (cron jobs)
- Set function timeout to 10s (Hobby limit)
- Maintained all security headers

## Current Branch State

```
Local main branch (27b3584):
  └─ Merge: deployment + production features
      ├─ Fix vercel.json for Hobby plan
      ├─ Add Vercel production deployment setup
      └─ Origin/main features (WebSocket, AI, etc.)

Remote origin/main (1950471):
  └─ Production stability and streaming features
```

## Next Steps to Deploy

### Option 1: Remove Branch Protection (Quick)

1. Go to GitHub → Repository Settings → Branches
2. Temporarily disable branch protection on `main`
3. Push the changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Re-enable branch protection

### Option 2: Force Push (If Needed)

If you have permissions:
```bash
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

### Option 3: Configure Vercel to Watch Main

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → Git
4. Set **Production Branch** to `main`
5. Save changes

Vercel will automatically deploy from the main branch.

### Option 4: Keep Using Feature Branch

If you prefer feature-branch deployments:
```bash
# Merge main back into feature branch
git checkout claude/setup-production-deployment-011CUbNvVuZPsm3CSxgnxKGc
git merge main
git push origin claude/setup-production-deployment-011CUbNvVuZPsm3CSxgnxKGc
```

Then configure Vercel to watch this branch.

## Recommended Workflow Going Forward

### For Production Deployments

```
main (production)              ← Vercel deploys from here
  ↑
  PR (code review)
  ↑
feature branches               ← Development work
```

### Branch Strategy

1. **main**: Production-ready code only
   - Auto-deploys to Vercel
   - Protected (requires PR to merge)
   - Always stable

2. **Feature branches**: New features/fixes
   - Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
   - Create PR to main when ready
   - Vercel creates preview deployments

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Make changes
# ... edit files ...

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add my feature"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

Then create PR on GitHub to merge into main.

## Vercel Deployment Commands

```bash
# Check deployment readiness
npm run vercel:check

# Preview deployment (test before production)
npm run vercel:preview

# Production deployment (after merge to main)
npm run vercel:deploy

# Pull environment variables
npm run vercel:env
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: 403 Error on Push
**Cause**: Branch protection on main
**Solution**: Use Option 1 or 3 above

### Issue: Deployment Not Triggering
**Cause**: Vercel watching wrong branch
**Solution**: Configure Vercel to watch `main` branch

### Issue: Build Failures
**Cause**: Missing environment variables or Hobby plan limits
**Solution**:
1. Check `vercel.json` uses Hobby-compatible settings
2. Verify all env vars set in Vercel dashboard
3. Run `npm run vercel:check` locally

## Current Branch Protection Status

The main branch appears to have branch protection enabled, which is good for production but requires:
- Pull request reviews before merging
- Status checks to pass
- Admin permissions to force push

**Recommendation**: Keep protection enabled and use PR workflow for safety.

## Files Modified in This Setup

- `vercel.json` - Hobby plan compatible configuration
- `package.json` - Added vercel deployment scripts
- `PRODUCTION_QUICKSTART.md` - 5-minute deployment guide
- `scripts/vercel-setup-checklist.js` - Pre-deployment validation
- `scripts/vercel-production-setup.js` - Interactive setup wizard
- `vercel.pro.json` - Pro plan config for future upgrade
- `README.md` - Updated with deployment instructions

## Ready to Deploy!

Your DirectFanz platform is ready for production deployment. Choose one of the options above to push to origin/main, then Vercel will automatically deploy.
